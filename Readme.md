## **Ohana3DS Simple**

### **What is Ohana3DS-Simple?**

Ohana3DS is a work in progress tool used to ONLY extract data from decrypted 3DS roms.

This version is a revamp of Rebirth, but in console application form, to ONLY be used to extract data.

This way you could do cool stuff like writing batch scripts so you can easily intergrate it into your own stuff using only the executable.

Example of exporting a '.bcres' to '.dae' using a batch script.
```
@echo off
"Ohana3DS Simple" -e "test model file.bcres" dae
pause
```
